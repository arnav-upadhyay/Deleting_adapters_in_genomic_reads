# Deleting_adapters_in_genomic_reads

So if you ever submit a genome raw reads to NCBI, the first thing is that the Curators of NCBI will send you is the list of contamination (Adapters, bacterial, animal DNA).

Using this list, I made a code which deleted Adapters from these sequences.

I used PANDAS and biopython to write the code.
